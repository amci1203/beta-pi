# My Skeleton

-----------------------------

The boilerplate is from Brad Schiff's [Git a Web Developer Job](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/learn/v4/content) course on Udemy.
The gulp tasks, and various configs have been left in tack, while the site specific html and css were left out. Browsersync, Babel, Modernizr, and Webpack are all already set up so that more time can be spent working on what you're doing. 

-----------------------------

### Gulp Tasks

1.  default: starts browsersync and watches index.html, CSS, and JS files.
2.  icons: creates an SVG & PNG spritesheet using the icons in app/assets/images/icons.
3.  build: builds a minified, production ready docs folder.

-----------------------------

### Notes

-  this project uses postCSS; feel free to change it (obviously)

#### Happy Coding! I hope you find this useful.
