# My Scaffold

-----------------------------

The boilerplate is based from Brad Schiff's [Git a Web Developer Job](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/learn/v4/content) course on Udemy.
The gulp tasks, and various configs have been left in tack, while the site specific html and css were left out. Browsersync, Babel, Modernizr, and Webpack are all set up so that more time can be spent working on what you're doing.

As this is mainly a personal project and I'm a bit busy nowadays, you'll have to excuse the lack of documentation for now. Look through the code--I promise it isn't that hard to figure out most of it.

-----------------------------

### Gulp Tasks

1.  default: starts browsersync and watches index.html, app/views, app/assets/css, and ap/assets/css.
2.  icons: creates an SVG & PNG spritesheet using the icons in app/assets/images/icons.
3.  build: builds a minified, production ready docs folder.
